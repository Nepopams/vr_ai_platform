# Check Docs

Verify documentation consistency with code:

1. **service-catalog.md** - Check services are documented
2. **CLAUDE.md** - Verify tech stack is current
3. **contracts/** - Ensure API contracts exist
4. **ADRs** - Check for missing decisions

## Checklist

- [ ] `docs/architecture/service-catalog.md` has all services
- [ ] `CLAUDE.md` Technology Stack matches implementation
- [ ] `docs/contracts/http/commands.openapi.yaml` exists
- [ ] JSON Schemas exist for all command types
- [ ] ADR exists for Stage 1 decisions
